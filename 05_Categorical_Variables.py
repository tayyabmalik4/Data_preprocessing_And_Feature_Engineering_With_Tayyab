# ----Purpose---
# ---What is Categorical Variables?
# ---Examples
# ---What are the Types of Categorical Variables


# *******What is Categorical Variables
# ----Definition----The values of A Categorical Variable are selected from a group of categorical, also caleed labels.
# -----For Example----Grade,Quality,Days,Products,Language----Grade(A,D,C,E,F),Quality(Poor,Good,Very Good,Excellent),Days(Monday,Tuesday,Wednesday,Thursday,Friday,Saturday,Sunday),Products(Laptop,Bag,Mouse,Torch),Language(Python,Java,C++,C,Go,R,Ruby in Rails) 

# ************Types of Categorical Variable
# ----Ordinal
# ----Nominal

# -----Ordinal Variable
# ----Definition----Ordinal Variable are categorical variable in which the categories can be meaningfully ordered. 
# ---When the ordinal variable convert into the number then it has mathematical value.
# ---Example---Rating of Product
# -----it converts the mathematical form ---Ordinal Variable can convered the numaric form because its shape is a order way
# ----for example---Grade(A,B,C,D,E,F) it converts to Grade(1,2,3,4,5),Quality(Poor,Good,Very Good, Excellent, Extreme Excellent, EE ka Bap) it converts to (1,2,3,4,5,6) and we also converets months name to numaric form Months(Jan,Feb,Mar,Apr,May,Jun) converts Months(1,2,3,4,5,6)


# -----Nominal Variables
# ---Definition---Nominal variable is same like ordinal variablee but there is nothing that indicates an intrinsic order of the labels and in principle.
# ----All labels are equal no order
# ----For Example---Products(Laptop,Bag,Mouse,Torch,Mobile,Shirt),Language(Python,Java,C++,C,Go,R,Ruby Rails)
# ----No mathematical values
# ----Ex. Color: Red,Green,White,Black.
