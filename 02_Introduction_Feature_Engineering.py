# ********What is Feature Engineering?
# ----Feature-Definition---Feature is an attribute or property shaered by all of the independent units on which analysis or prediction is to be done
# ----Engineering-Definition---Engineering is the process to solve the problems and creating new inventing something.
# ----Defintion of Feature Engineering--- Feature Engineeing is the process to creat feature/extract the feature from existing feactures by domain knowledge to increase the performance of Machine Learning Model.
# ----Feature Engineering is an Art---

# ******Why is Feature Engineering Importance?
# ------Quality data always help to improve the accuracy and performance of Machine Learning model.
# -----Machine Learning algorithm follow the rule (learn like kids)
# ....GIGO----(garbage in  garbage out)

# ------Data---->>>>Feature Engineering----->>>>>Machine Learning Model 

# ********Major Process of Feature Engineering:
# ---Brainstorming or testing features
# ---Deciding what features to creat 
# ---Creating features
# ---Checking how the features work with your model
# ---Improving your features if needed
# ---Go back to brainstorming/Creating more features until the work is done 


# *******Prerequisites
# ////Python Libraries
# ---(1)-Numpy 
# ---(2)-pandas
# ---(3)-matplotlib
# ---(4)-Seaborn
# ---(5)-scikit learn 
# ////Mathematics study
# ---(1)-Statistics
# ---(2)-Probability
# ---(3)-Calculus
# ---(4)-Linear Algebra

# *******Software or IDE which we use 
# ----we use Anaconda(jupyter & spyder)
# ----But we use VS code because we uploaded the files in github and if we use jupyter notebook than we no read the code in the github directly
