# (03)*********************Variables in Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering *********************

# /////we discuss about
# ---What is Variable
# ---Examples
# ---What are the type of variables


# *******What is Variable?
# ---definition---A variable is any characteristic, number, or quanity that can be measured or counted.

# ***********Types of Variable
# /////Numarical(numbers)
# /////Categorical(String)
# ////Dates and times(part of Categorical)
# ////Mixed(mixed means include the numarical and Categorical values)

# ********Numarical Types
# ----Discrete----means age---integer value---26,20
# ----Continious----means weight----float value---- 52.34kg etc

# *******Categorical
# ----ordinal-----means week----who are preplanned---for example----sunday,monday,tuesday is goning to in order
# ----Norminal----other all variables is called Norminal like ---color pf car,computer,laptop 


# ---We decided the applying some algorithms and rules to fill the nan values so first of all we analyze that the variables are types than we operate it and decision it.
