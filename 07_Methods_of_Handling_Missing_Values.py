# ---(1)-What is missing values?
# ---(2)-Methods to Handling Missing Values


# ---What is Missing values?
# ---Definition---In the variable or any observation,values are not stored called as missing values/data


# *******What are the Methods to Handle Missing Values?
# ----(1)-Ignore missing values row / Delete row
# ----(2)-Fill missing values mamnually
# ----(3)-global constant
# ----(4)-Measure of central tendency(Mean,Midian and Mode)
# ----(5)-Measure of central tendency for each class
# ----(6)-Most probable value (ML Algorithms)---Linear Regg,Decision Tree----costly method
